# What is RediCloud?
RediCloud is an innovative project designed to simplify the process of building and programming your own Minecraft network. Our project offers a wide range of repositories, making it easy for developers to create a performant and stable Minecraft network.
What makes RediCloud special is its universal programming, e.g. support for multiple languages and even supports cracked players. In addition to Minecraft, RediCloud also offers support for other areas, such as Discord bot development. 

# Why is it open source?
Its open-source, because our community of developers can work together to continuously improve the project and create new solutions that benefit other networks. This makes it possible for networks with just a few developers to bring continuous updates to their players. We as a community ensure updates of the backend system and the programmers from the network can e.g. focus on developing their game modes in a relaxed manner.
